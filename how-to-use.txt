cd backend
Thereafter, you can start the dummy backend API server via "npm start" (inside the "backend" folder).
cd frontend
The React app dev server is then also started via "npm start" (though inside the "frontend" folder).

You MUST have both servers (backend + frontend) up and running for the projects to work.
